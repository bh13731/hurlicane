You are the IMPLEMENTER agent in a structured autonomous agent run with assess/review/implement phases.
Your task in this phase is to **assess the codebase and propose a plan**.

## Task
${workflow.task}

## Working Directory
${workflow.work_dir ?? '(not specified)'}

## Instructions

1. **Read the codebase** — scan the project structure, key files, tests, dependencies, and configuration.
2. **Assess quality** — note any issues, patterns, tech debt, missing tests, or areas for improvement relevant to the task.
3. **Write a plan** with concrete milestones as markdown checkboxes. Each milestone should be achievable in a single implementation cycle.
4. **Size milestones for the turn budget** — the implement phase has approximately **${effectiveMaxTurns(workflow.stop_mode_implement, workflow.stop_value_implement)} turns** per cycle. Size each milestone to be completable within ~30-40 tool calls. If a milestone seems too large, split it into smaller sub-milestones.

## Plan Format

Write the plan to the shared scratchpad using \`write_note\` with key \`${planKey}\`. Use this exact format:

\`\`\`markdown
# Plan

## Goal
<one-line description of what this autonomous agent run aims to achieve>

## Assessment
<brief assessment of current state relevant to the task>

## Milestones
- [ ] **M1: <title>** [S] — <description with clear acceptance criteria>
- [ ] **M2: <title>** [M] — <description with clear acceptance criteria>
- [ ] **M3: <title>** [L] — <description with clear acceptance criteria>
(add as many as needed, but keep each achievable in one cycle)

Annotate each milestone with a complexity estimate: [S] ~10 tool calls, [M] ~25, [L] ~40, [XL] ~60+.
Total estimated tool calls across all milestones should not exceed ${effectiveMaxTurns(workflow.stop_mode_implement, workflow.stop_value_implement)} × ${workflow.max_cycles} cycles = ${effectiveMaxTurns(workflow.stop_mode_implement, workflow.stop_value_implement) * workflow.max_cycles} total. If over budget, reduce scope or split milestones.

## Priority Order
<which milestone to tackle first and why>

## Risks
<known risks, dependencies between milestones, or blockers>
\`\`\`

## Contract

Also write the operating contract using \`write_note\` with key \`${contractKey}\`:

\`\`\`markdown
# Autonomous Agent Run Contract
- One agent works at a time (no concurrent edits)
- Plan milestones use checkbox format: \`- [ ]\` unchecked, \`- [x]\` checked
- Worklog entries are append-only
- If blocked, explain clearly so the next agent can resolve it
- All existing tests must pass before marking a milestone complete
- Changes must be committed with descriptive messages
\`\`\`

## Important
- Use \`write_note("${planKey}", <plan content>)\` to store the plan.
- Use \`write_note("${contractKey}", <contract content>)\` to store the contract.
- Do NOT implement anything yet — this is assessment and planning only.${workflow.worktree_branch ? `
- **You are on branch \`${workflow.worktree_branch}\`. Do NOT switch branches or checkout main.**` : ''}
- Call \`report_status\` to update your progress.`;

## Step ${hasInline ? 1 : 2}: Review Quality Bar

Before updating the plan, you must critically evaluate it. Identify **at least 2 concrete improvements** — for example:
- Missing edge cases or error scenarios not covered by any milestone
- Vague or untestable acceptance criteria that need sharpening
- Wrong ordering or missing dependencies between milestones
- Missing milestones for testing, documentation, or cleanup
- Milestones that are too large to complete in a single implementation cycle

If you genuinely cannot find 2 improvements, you must explicitly explain with specific evidence why the plan is already exceptional — citing how each milestone has clear acceptance criteria, correct ordering, appropriate scope, and complete coverage of the task. "Plan looks good" is never sufficient.
`;

  const codeReviewSection = isFirstReview ? '' : `
## Step ${hasInline ? 1 : 2}: Code Review (MOST IMPORTANT)

The implementer just completed cycle ${cycle - 1}. You must review the actual code changes before touching the plan.

1. ${hasInline ? 'Review the worklog in the Pre-loaded Context section below.' : `Read the worklog for what was changed: \`read_note("${worklogKey}")\``}
2. In the working directory (${workflow.work_dir ?? 'project root'}), inspect the implementation:
   - Run \`git log --oneline -10\` to see recent commits
   - Run \`git diff HEAD~1\` (or \`git diff HEAD~<n>\` to cover all commits from this cycle) to see exact code changes
   - Read any new or heavily modified files in full
   - Run the test suite to check for regressions. If the test suite fails due to missing dependencies or environment issues (e.g. \`ModuleNotFoundError\`, \`No module named\`, \`command not found\`, \`pytest: command not found\`), note the environment gap in your review but do NOT block the milestone or add fix milestones for environment setup — focus on code correctness from reading the implementation instead.
3. **Assess code quality** — look for:
   - Correctness: does it actually satisfy the milestone's acceptance criteria?
   - Edge cases: null/undefined handling, empty arrays, concurrency, off-by-one errors
   - Error handling: are failures surfaced properly or silently swallowed?
   - Test coverage: are the new code paths tested? Are tests meaningful or just for coverage?
   - Code style and consistency with the surrounding codebase
   - Security: injection, unvalidated inputs, secrets in code
   - Performance: N+1 queries, unnecessary re-renders, blocking operations
4. **Review for genuine issues** — look for correctness bugs, missing edge cases, test gaps, or deviations from the milestone's acceptance criteria. If you find real issues, add fix milestones:
   \`- [ ] **Fix: <short title>** — <specific description of what needs to change and why>\`
   Only add milestones for issues that would cause bugs, data loss, or user-visible problems. Do NOT add milestones for stylistic preferences, speculative hardening, or "nice to have" improvements. If the implementation meets its acceptance criteria and tests pass, approve it and move on — the goal is forward progress, not perfection.

If you do add fix milestones, be specific — vague feedback like "improve error handling" is not actionable.

4. **Write smoke tests** — create targeted tests that exercise the changed functionality against the running application. Test the happy path and key edge cases. Focus on behavior, not implementation details.
5. **Run the tests** — execute them and capture results.

- Clean up any test files you create when done.
