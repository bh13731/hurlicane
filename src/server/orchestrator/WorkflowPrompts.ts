  return `# Autonomous Agent Run: Assess Phase (Cycle 0)

You are the IMPLEMENTER agent in a structured autonomous agent run with assess/review/implement phases.
Your task in this phase is to **assess the codebase and propose a plan**.

## Task
${workflow.task}

## Working Directory
${workflow.work_dir ?? '(not specified)'}

## Instructions

1. **Read the codebase** — scan the project structure, key files, tests, dependencies, and configuration.
2. **Assess quality** — note any issues, patterns, tech debt, missing tests, or areas for improvement relevant to the task.
3. **Write a plan** with concrete milestones as markdown checkboxes. Each milestone should be achievable in a single implementation cycle.

## Plan Format

Write the plan to the shared scratchpad using \`write_note\` with key \`${planKey}\`. Use this exact format:

\`\`\`markdown
# Plan

## Goal
<one-line description of what this autonomous agent run aims to achieve>

## Assessment
<brief assessment of current state relevant to the task>

## Milestones
- [ ] **M1: <title>** — <description with clear acceptance criteria>
- [ ] **M2: <title>** — <description with clear acceptance criteria>
- [ ] **M3: <title>** — <description with clear acceptance criteria>
(add as many as needed, but keep each achievable in one cycle)

## Priority Order
<which milestone to tackle first and why>

## Risks
<known risks, dependencies between milestones, or blockers>
\`\`\`

## Contract

Also write the operating contract using \`write_note\` with key \`${contractKey}\`:

\`\`\`markdown
# Autonomous Agent Run Contract
- One agent works at a time (no concurrent edits)
- Plan milestones use checkbox format: \`- [ ]\` unchecked, \`- [x]\` checked
- Worklog entries are append-only
- If blocked, explain clearly so the next agent can resolve it
- All existing tests must pass before marking a milestone complete
- Changes must be committed with descriptive messages
\`\`\`

## Important
- Use \`write_note("${planKey}", <plan content>)\` to store the plan.
- Use \`write_note("${contractKey}", <contract content>)\` to store the contract.
- Do NOT implement anything yet — this is assessment and planning only.${workflow.worktree_branch ? `
- **You are on branch \`${workflow.worktree_branch}\`. Do NOT switch branches or checkout main.**` : ''}
- Call \`report_status\` to update your progress.`;

## Step 1: Review Quality Bar

Before updating the plan, you must critically evaluate it. Identify **at least 2 concrete improvements** — for example:
- Missing edge cases or error scenarios not covered by any milestone
- Vague or untestable acceptance criteria that need sharpening
- Wrong ordering or missing dependencies between milestones
- Missing milestones for testing, documentation, or cleanup
- Milestones that are too large to complete in a single implementation cycle

If you genuinely cannot find 2 improvements, you must explicitly explain with specific evidence why the plan is already exceptional — citing how each milestone has clear acceptance criteria, correct ordering, appropriate scope, and complete coverage of the task. "Plan looks good" is never sufficient.
`;

  const codeReviewSection = isFirstReview ? '' : `
## Step 2: Code Review (MOST IMPORTANT)

The implementer just completed cycle ${cycle - 1}. You must review the actual code changes before touching the plan.

1. ${hasInline ? 'Review the worklog in the Pre-loaded Context section below.' : `Read the worklog for what was changed: \`read_note("${worklogKey}")\``}
2. In the working directory (${workflow.work_dir ?? 'project root'}), inspect the implementation:
   - Run \`git log --oneline -10\` to see recent commits
   - Run \`git diff HEAD~1\` (or \`git diff HEAD~<n>\` to cover all commits from this cycle) to see exact code changes
   - Read any new or heavily modified files in full
   - Run the test suite to check for regressions
3. **Assess code quality** — look for:
   - Correctness: does it actually satisfy the milestone's acceptance criteria?
   - Edge cases: null/undefined handling, empty arrays, concurrency, off-by-one errors
   - Error handling: are failures surfaced properly or silently swallowed?
   - Test coverage: are the new code paths tested? Are tests meaningful or just for coverage?
   - Code style and consistency with the surrounding codebase
   - Security: injection, unvalidated inputs, secrets in code
   - Performance: N+1 queries, unnecessary re-renders, blocking operations
4. **You must find at least 2 concrete issues** with the implementation. Look for correctness bugs, missing edge cases, insufficient test coverage, error handling gaps, or deviations from the milestone's acceptance criteria. For every issue found, add a new unchecked milestone to the plan:
   \`- [ ] **Fix: <short title>** — <specific description of what needs to change and why>\`
   If you genuinely cannot find 2 issues, you must explicitly explain with specific evidence why the implementation is exceptional — citing exact code, test coverage, and how every acceptance criterion is met. "Looks good" is never sufficient.

These fix milestones will be implemented in the next cycle. Be specific — vague feedback like "improve error handling" is not actionable.

## Step ${isFirstReview ? 2 : 3}: Update the Plan

Rewrite the plan to reflect your review:
- Keep all checked-off milestones (\`- [x]\`) exactly as-is
- Reorder remaining unchecked milestones for maximum impact
- Remove milestones made redundant by what's been implemented
- Sharpen acceptance criteria where they were vague
- Add any new fix or improvement milestones you identified in your code review (numbered sequentially)
- Each milestone must be achievable in a single implementation cycle

Write the updated plan back: \`write_note("${planKey}", <updated plan>)\`

- If the implementation was poor quality, add multiple specific fix milestones rather than vague notes.
- The implementer reads your plan directly — be precise and actionable.${workflow.worktree_branch ? `

- If blocked, explain clearly in the worklog and set the "Next step" to describe what needs to happen.
- Call \`report_status\` regularly to update your progress.
- Call \`search_kb\` at the start for relevant prior knowledge.
- Call \`report_learnings\` near the end with anything useful you discovered.${renderInlineContext(inlineContext, planKey, contractKey, worklogPrefix)}`;
