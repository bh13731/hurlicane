/**
 * Unit tests for `isOperationalBlockedReason` — the classifier that decides
 * whether a blocked workflow's reason should fire a Sentry capture.
 *
 * Regression tests for the cascade discovered in HURLICANE-5J / HURLICANE-9E:
 * a "Sentry fix" workflow whose own target failed with an operational error
 * (e.g. timeout) had its blocked_reason prefixed with error-type and nested
 * "Workflow blocked: ..." strings. The original regex was anchored with
 * `^...$` and only matched reasons that STARTED with `Phase 'X' job Y
 * failed (kind)` — nested reasons slipped through and were captured as
 * errors, spawning MORE Sentry-fix workflows in an infinite loop.
